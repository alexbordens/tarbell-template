    'quote': u"To know every detail of the oil trade, to be able to reach at any moment its remotest point, to control even its weakest factor \u2014 this was John D. Rockefeller's ideal of doing business. It seemed to be an intellectual necessity for him to be able to direct the course of any particular gallon of oil from the moment it gushed from the earth until it went into the lamp of a housewife. \n\nThere must be nothing \u2014 nothing in his great machine he did not know to be working right. It was to complete this ideal, to satisfy this necessity, that he undertook, late in the seventies, to organise the oil markets of the world, as he had already organised oil refining and oil transporting.",
